#### In Class Git Activity 
Having previous git experience, I went into the Git activity thinking that it would be a 
But sadly that was not the case. In my group, I was the first person to make push any chances, so I didn't encounter any changes. But as time went on, everytime I tried to push a change, I was met with the following error :

*hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. git pull ...') before pushing again. See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.*

I was able to resolve these conflicts by pulling from master, merging the changes, then pushing my changes. Overall, this wass a great opportunity to relearn git basics and work with my fellow classmates.

#### On Line Readings
Out of the assigned readings for this week, Shubheksha's [A Beginner’s Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source] was the one that had a profound impact on me. The author effortlessly captures the feeling of being a beginner in a unfamilar enviorment. It's common to take the easy way out by completing tasks that are simple and require no external help but that doesn't help anyone grow. The point of open source is to **collaborate** with strangers and make a meaningful impact while improving your skillset. 
It's unfortunate that Shubheksha was met with pushback, when they finally felt comfortable asking for help and as a result "the world of open source felt like a closed enviornment". 
A community built on sharing should be more welcoming to beginners and encourage their contibution because after all the only way to learn is by asking questions and contributing. From Shubheksha's experience, I learned the importance of asking questions and not being afraid to ask for help when something is unclear.

Overall, the article does a great job at pointing out the flaws within the open source community and providing useful advice for beginniers interested in contributing.
