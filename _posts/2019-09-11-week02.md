### My First Contribution?

Prior to reading [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding], I thought that the only way to contribute to an open source project involved writing lines of code. It never occured to me that other actions such as documentation, translating programs into various languages or submitting bug reports were equally valued. As a result, I started thinking about my interaction with various products 
and the qualities I deem to be importortant. To me, the design and usability of a product is just as important as the functionality. After all, what's the point of a product if no one knows how to use it?

Aside from being a coder, I'm a designer at heart and in my spare time I love to build websites and create mockups for applications. 
Combining with my skillset, I'd be interested in designing a better user interface, helping maintain a web site, or creating graphics for an open source project.

#### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?
