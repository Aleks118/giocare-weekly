### My First Contribution?

Prior to reading [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding], I thought that the only way to contribute to an open source project involved writing lines of code. It never occured to me that other actions such as documentation, translating programs into various languages or [insert another example] were equally valued. As a result, I started thinking about my interaction with various websites 
and the qualities I deem to be importortant. To me, the design and usability of a product is just as important as the functionality. 


Aside from being a coder, I'm a designer at heart and in my spare time I love to build websites and create mockups for applications. As a result, I'd be interested in designing a better user interface, help maintain a web site for an Open Source project, Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation and Submit graphics (icons, backgrounds) to use in the program. 

#### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?
