### First Contributions?

#### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project?

Prior to reading How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding, I thought that the only way to contribute to an open source project 

For me, the design and usability of a product is just as important as the functionality. 
As a result, for my first contribution I'd be interested in design a better user interface, Help maintain a web site for an Open Source project, Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation and Submit graphics (icons, backgrounds) to use in the program. 

#### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?
