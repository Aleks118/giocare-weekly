### Debunking Open Source Myths?

https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/

Some of the ten statements discussed in this short article are things you might have thought before you took this course, and some you still might not have realized. In your blog for Week 3, write about what you have learned so far with respect to these statements. For example, did you know that it is not always free of cost? Try to be specific and try to give examples.

üïµÔ∏è Myth #1 : Source Code ‚â† Free

üïµÔ∏è Myth #2 : Programmers Only Club

üïµÔ∏è Myth #3 : Widespread Usage


By the end of this course, I'd like to use more open source softwares on a daily basis.
